 to event data. In survival analysis we use the term failure to de ne the occurrence of the event of interest
 (even though the event may actually be a success such as recovery from therapy). The term survival
 time speci es the length of time taken for failure to occur. Situations where survival analyses have been
 used in epidemiology include:
